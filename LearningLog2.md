# Learning Log 2
*For the week beginning 15/03/21*

## What have I done this week?
| Resource Used | Time Spent (hrs) | Explanation | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C++ course on CodeAcademny | ~8 | Refreshed C++ skills by completing 40% of a 25 hour online tutorial. | [Here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus) |
| Servo Motor Circuit | ~2 | Read through the documentation for servos then created a program that moved the servo linearly using a sin function | [Here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/) |
| Joystick control circuit | ~2 | Created a circuit that reads and displays values on a joystick. Adapted from the example to output onto a digital display rather than an LED matrix | [Here](https://exploreembedded.com/wiki/Analog_JoyStick_with_Arduino) |

## What have I learnt?
After completing the tutorial I now feel more confident using many features that I already use in other higher level languages in my programs including classes and functions.
As well as this, I am now more familiar with the parts of C++ that are more unique like binary operations, references and pointers.

Most of what I have learned this week with respect to the Arduino has come from reading through the documentation on the official arduino website. It contains plenty of information on what libraries can be installed included in my programs as well as what function come pre-loaded.
As well of this the website contains circuit diagrams and code snippets for key examples that have been very helpful for a beginner in electronics.

## Planned changes to goals
At the end of this week I am slightly behind where I wanted to be with regards to the complexity of circuits I was creating.
This is partly due to spending a lot more completing a tutorial C++ and partly due to not having a stepper motor or radio transmitter / receiver needed to make some circuits crucial for week 4
Because of this, I am going to scale back my original plans and use next two weeks to create a working radio transmitter / receiver program rather than contributing to an online project.
It will be very useful to go into the last two weeks with an understanding on all of the components needed for the project, not just for planning my contribution but also for the rest of the team.
