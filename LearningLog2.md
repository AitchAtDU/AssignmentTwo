# Learning Log 2
*For the week beginning 15/03/21*

## What have I done this week?
| Task | Time Spent (hrs) | Explanation | Link to resources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C++ course on CodeAcademny | ~8 | Refreshed C++ skills by completing 40% of a 25 hour online tutorial. | [Here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus) |
| Servo Motor Circuit | ~2 | Read through the documentation for servos then created a program that moved the servo linearly using a sin function | [Here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/) |
| Joystick control circuit | ~2 | Created a circuit that reads and displays values on a joystick. Adapted from the example to output onto a digital display rather than an LED matrix | [Here](https://exploreembedded.com/wiki/Analog_JoyStick_with_Arduino) |

## What have I learnt?
After completing the tutorial I now feel more confident using common features of C++ like data structures, classes and functions.
As well as this, I am now more familiar with the parts of C++ that are more unique like binary operations, references and pointers.

Much of what I have learned this week has come from reading through the documentation for different libraries on the official arduino website. It contains plenty of information on what libraries can be installed included in my programs as well as what function come pre-loaded.
As well of this the website contains circuit diagrams and code snippets for key examples. Looking forward I aim to fully utilise this resource.

## Planned changes to goals
Coming to the halfway point of this project I am slightly behind my initial goal to have a clear understanding of the different components required for an RC flight controller.
Because of this, I am going to scale back my original plans and use next two weeks to create a working radio transmitter / receiver program rather than contributing to an additional online project.
With my limited understanding on writing code for Arduinos, I would not be able to contribute much in terms of writing code for an open source project. While other forms of contributions could still give me insight on how large open source projects are co-ordinated, it would be more beneficial to hone these skills first so I can make larger contributions to projects later on.
