# Learning to Program Electronics
*A guide on getting started with Arduino programming*

## Introduction
Arduino is an open-source electronics programming platform. They are responsible for designing and producing reporgrammable circuitboards that can be used as the basis for creating custom circuits.

This can be anything from a simple light switch to a blutooth controlled car. The limit to what circuits you can make is your imagination (Cheesy but True!)

## Why learn Arduino Programming?

Make your own circuits/inventions
- Could just be curious on how simple circuits work, or think you can design something better
- Such a versatile and creative skill

Better understanding of everyday electronics
- Don't take for granted

Future of electronics. Robotics
- Lots of jobs in engineering - increased demand for skills coming with the automation of such jobs.

Added benefit of refining C++ skills:
- Despite its age C++ is still widley used in modern life, mainly for programming low level applications that deal dirrectly with hardware
- Most languages are derivatives of C++ so improving your C++ will likely be helpful for learning many others

## What Prior knowledge do you need?
Programming an Arduino is a very beginner friendly task, almost no prior knowledge is required.  
C++ is the main language used when creating programs for an arduino so it can help to be familiar with the syntax.  
Even if you have had no experience with electronics before almost all online tutorials have circuit diagrams that are straight forward to follow.

## So, how do you start?
The first step is to buy an arduino.
There are many choices from different types of boards that Arduino offers, the most readily available,and cheap is the arduino uno. Due to it's availability, it is also has the most documentation in comparisn to the others making it perfectly suited for beginners.  
While Arduino do sell their own boards, there are many third party variations made by other manufacturers that are functionally identical but much cheaper.  
Many electronics stores offer kits that bundle together everything a beginner might need to begin programming an arduino including the circuit board itself, a breadboard, wires and a variety of components to build almost any type of circuit. While this can seem a bit overwhelming at first combining this with a tutorial is a great way to start (Gives the freedom of being able to customise and experiment circuits as you choose!)

## Helpful Resources
There are so many helpful resources online available for learning how to program an arduino.  
- Arduinos own website
- Howtomechatronics is an example of a youtube tutorial channel great for finding inspiration for a project.
- Some of the others that I have used and linked to throughout the project

## Gloassary of Terms
One thing that can deter new users away from learning how to program an arduino is all of the new terminology - can seem daunting. Here is are is a gloassary of some of the most frequently used terms:

## Annotated diagram of an arduino uno
Full image labelling
Zoomed in on the pins for labelling with extra colour coded information about specific *quirks* of each pin

## Evaluation of My Experience
Round up my experience with programming an Arduino. Was it worth it for me? Will it be worth it for the audience?

If you've made it this far into this guid then I'm willing to bet that you'll benefit from learning to program an arduino in one way or another.
