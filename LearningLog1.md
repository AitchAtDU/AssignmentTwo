# Learning Log 1
*For the week ending 28/02/21*

## What skill am I learning?
Over the next few months I am planning to learn how to:
 - Program in C++
 - Upload and implement into an arduino
 - Construct circuits using basic components to control with the arduino
### Why is it interesting and prevalent?
 - Want to get into electronics and this is a simplified way of doing so
 - Understand the type of programming that goes into electronics I use everyday
 - (Maybe unlock more career options in electrical engineering)
 - Looks fun! 
Eventually, I want to know enough about programming to collaborate with my brother and create a RC plane.
For this project he will be responsibe for building the body and the mechanics for the plane and I will create the circuitry and programming required for the plane to actually fly
I will need to know how to control servos using a microcontroller and how to build a radio reciever that can be used to interpret the input transmitted from a transmitter controller
### What do I know about the skill already
I've never formally coded in C++, but I am familiar with the layout and from other projects it seems to be similar to JS. Learning the language shouldn't be too difficult so my
focus will beb learning about how its implemented into arduino e.g. the functions and methods used as well as the data types they deal with. Apart from some basic introduction in
GCSE physics I have never studied electronics so I will need to learn how to follow circuit diagrams and how to wire components together to form a circuit
## Initial Goals
What aim to accomplish on a week by week basis
1. Get a grasp with the arduino software, learn bbasics of C++ and the methods/functions needed, learn about the hardware on the arduino
**More concrete than this** Build the circuits and run the 6 basic examples found in the software, customise the RGB one to display a colour based on a button press
1. Create more complex circuits involving motors and other components (variety of input, outputs). Start researching the components needed for the final collaborative project
1. Find and contribute to a beginner friendly open source arduino project (Find and contact them sooner than this). Continue making circuits and researching
1. Work with brother to construct an RC plane!

## What have I done this week?
Resources used, time spent on each resource, evidence of completion, what have I learned?
| Resource Used | Time Spent (hrs) | Why was this useful? | Link | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
