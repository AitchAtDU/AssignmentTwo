# Learning Log 1
*For the week beginning 01/03/21*

## What skill am I learning?
Over the next few months I am planning to learn how to:
 - Create basic control programs written in c++
 - Upload and run these programs on an arduino microcontroller
 - Construct circuits using basic components that programs can control
### Why am I learning it?
I would love to understand the type of programming that goes into making everyday electronics and learning to program an arduino is a simple way
of getting into it. Potentially a great foundation of the knowledge that's required for many careers for example an electrical engineer. In addition to this, programming in c++ is independently a useful skill practicing will compound my knowledge of other C based languages like javascript.
The primary reason for learning these skills is so I can collaborate with my brother to create an RC plane
For this project he will be responsibe for building the body and the mechanics for the plane and I will create the circuitry and programming for the plane to function
To do this, I will need to know how to control servos using a microcontroller and how to wire a radio reciever to the board that can be used to interpret the input transmitted from a transmitter controller.
### Prior knowledge
While I have never programmed in c++, I already know how to program in JS which in may ways should be similar. Therefore, I will have to learn it is implemented with respect to the arduino. Some examples of this would be the functions and methods used as well as the data types.
Aside from a basic introduction to circuitry in in GCSE physics I have never studied electronics so I will also need to learn how to design and follow circuit diagrams in addition to learning about the limitations of what circuits the arduino can control.
## Initial Goals
What aim to accomplish on a week by week basis
1. Get a grasp with the arduino software, become familiar with the methods/functions used to program an arduino, learn about the hardware on the arduino
1. Create more complex circuits involving motors and other components (variety of input, outputs). Start researching the components needed for the final collaborative project
1. Find and contribute to a beginner friendly open source arduino project (Find and contact them next week). Continue improving on the skills in week 2
1. Work with brother to construct an RC plane

## What have I done this week?
The following 
| Resource Used | Time Spent (hrs) | Explanation | Link | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4Ã—4 Matrix Keyboard with Arduino | ~4 | Followed the instructions outlined in the article and adapted them so the inbuilt light would blink the a number of times equal to which button was pressed | [Here](https://rydepier.wordpress.com/2015/10/20/4x4-matrix-keyboard-with-arduino/) | See Below |
| Arduino Built in Examples | ~6 | Completed the majority of the first 3 groups of examples. | [Here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples) | See Below |

## Planned changes to Goals
From adapting some of the examples I found that my knowledge of c++ was holding me back from doing some of the things I wanted to like creating a function that maps a gradient of colours to the RGB led. To fix this over the next two weeks I am going to complete a intermediate course on c++
